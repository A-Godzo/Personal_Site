      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Born in Struga, North Macedonia,I completed both my elementary and high school education in my hometown, where I developed a strong academic foundation and passion for the sciences. Throughout my school years, I actively participated in numerous mathematical competitions, consistently demonstrating analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
        My interest in physics led me to deliver a presentation on The Refraction of Light at the Society of Physicists of the Republic of Macedonia in Skopjeâ€”an experience that strengthened my communication abilities and deepened my scientific curiosity.

<br>
      <p>
      I have successfully completed a B2 English Language Course, further enhancing my ability to engage with international academic content and communicate effectively in a global context. In recognition of my academic achievements, I was honored with the Student of the Generation award upon graduating from high school.
      </p>
<br>
      <p>
      I am currently a first-year student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI) in Skopje, pursuing my interests in computing and technology. Outside of academics, I enjoy watching films, playing video games, and swimming, which help me maintain a balanced and creative lifestyle.
